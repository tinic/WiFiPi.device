/* THE LINK HEADER, WRITTEN ONCE INSTEAD OF COPIED TWICE.
 *
 * Without it the fourteen bytes travel a long way for what they are: the
 * device lifts the two addresses out of the frame into ios2_SrcAddr and
 * ios2_DstAddr, and the opener lifts them back out of the request into the
 * packet and adds the type -- four six-byte moves and a word, per frame, for
 * bytes the device was already holding.
 *
 * Set, and the device writes the WHOLE fourteen-byte header at the fourteen
 * bytes IMMEDIATELY BEFORE the pointer RX_DIRECT answered, then fills the
 * request fields as before.  The opener may then skip synthesising it.
 *
 * ONLY MEANINGFUL WITH RX_DIRECT, and only on a cooked read: the direct path
 * refuses SANA2IOF_RAW requests already (netdev_direct.c:145), because a raw
 * destination starts at the frame and there is nothing in front of it.  An
 * opener that sets this promises those fourteen bytes are its own to write.
 *
 * ti_Data IS A POINTER TO A BOOL, NOT A FLAG AND NOT A HOOK.  A device that
 * understands the tag sets it TRUE; one that does not leaves it alone, and the
 * opener then knows to keep synthesising.  There is no other way round: the
 * tag list is one-way, RX_FILLED's signature is published and cannot grow an
 * argument, and an opener that guessed from RX_FILLED alone would hand a
 * third-party direct-path driver's frames a header of stale bytes. */

/* MORE IN RX_FILLED's LAST ARGUMENT THAN A YES OR NO.
 *
 * `summed` was a boolean.  It is a flag byte now, and the old meaning is its
 * low bit, so a device and an opener that know only the boolean still agree:
 * a device that sets SUMMED alone is the device there was, and an opener that
 * tests `!= 0` sees the same thing it saw, because the two new bits are only
 * ever set by a device that was told it may.
 *
 * VERIFIED   the device checked this frame itself: the IPv4 header checksum
 *            and the TCP or UDP checksum, from the sum its copy already
 *            produced and the headers it had in cache.  The opener may skip
 *            its own walk and mark the packet's checksums as done.  Never set
 *            on a frame with Ethernet padding past the IP total length, an
 *            IP header with options, a fragment, or a UDP checksum of zero.
 * CONTINUES  this frame's TCP payload is the next bytes of the SAME stream as
 *            the frame the device delivered immediately before it: same
 *            addresses and ports, the previous segment's end is this one's
 *            sequence number, the same acknowledgment, window and flags
 *            (ACK, or ACK+PSH), no TCP options, both VERIFIED.  An opener may
 *            chain the two into one segment -- the receive side of what a
 *            large-receive-offload does -- and hand the stack one packet
 *            where the wire carried several.  It is a hint about the bytes,
 *            not an instruction: an opener that has already delivered the
 *            previous frame delivers this one whole, and nothing is lost.
 *
 * ANXD_S2_RX_FLAGS, in the buffer-management list, is how an opener says it
 * understands the two.  ti_Data IS A POINTER TO A UBYTE.  The opener may
 * preload the flags it wants; the device replaces them with the intersection
 * it accepted and sets only those from then on.  A zero input retains the
 * first published contract and asks for every flag the device supports, so an
 * older opener and a newer device still agree.  CONTINUES requires VERIFIED;
 * an opener may request VERIFIED alone.  Without the tag a device sets SUMMED
 * alone, whatever it could have said. */

 * device replaces the byte with the intersection it will honour, ASKED
 * cleared.  A device that does not know the tag leaves the byte alone, and
 * the opener that reads ASKED back knows nothing was agreed: a device that
 * answers every other tag here and not this one would otherwise be sent
 * frames whose checksum field it never finishes.  For each bit accepted, a
 * CMD_WRITE that carries
 * ANXD_S2IOF_L4_CSUM in io_Flags promises: a cooked IPv4 datagram, not a
 * fragment, whose transport header is TCP (TXF_TCP) or UDP (TXF_UDP), and
 * whose checksum field holds the ones-complement sum of the pseudo-header,
 * folded to sixteen bits and not complemented.  The device sums the
 * transport header and payload on top of it and writes the complement into
 * the field before the frame leaves; the opener writes nothing else there.
 * The bit is in SANA-II's unused part of io_Flags (bits 1-4) and is set only

/* ANXD_CMD_RX_CAPACITY: "how much can your hardware hold from the wire?"

 * Answered in ios2_DataLength: the bytes of received frames the unit's own

 * or FIFO after which the next frame is lost.  A card that can pause the
 * wire instead may answer 0, which means "no limit worth stating", and so
 * does a driver that cannot say.  Quick, no arguments, io_Error 0;

 *
 * What an opener does with it: keep the TCP window it advertises on that
 * interface inside the number, so a peer on the same LAN cannot put more
 * on the wire at once than the card can take.  Measured 2026-09-16 on an
 * A3000 (25 MHz 68030) with an X-Surf 100: a 100,352-byte window against
